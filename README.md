# LD38: Something about rockets that shrink planets!

This is my [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) 38 "Small Worlds" compo entry "Something about rockets that shrink planets!" (naming things is hard!).
I made this in ~18 hours using [Godot](https://godotengine.org). This is my first Godot project so it's quite messy ;).

"Something about rockets that shrink planets!" is a top down shooter thingy, where you have to protect your home planet from incoming ~~aliens~~ rockets (when you don't have time to makes good enemies
they become suicidal and then rockets!)

## Post mortem

* Working with Godot was a very pleasant experience
* I should've done something with it before this jam
* Too much code in too few files
* I learned a few cool tricks with the engine :).
* Attempting a very small scale game was a good idea (I've tried to participate in LD before and always overscaled)
* It was fun! I will probably make something for LD39 :).
